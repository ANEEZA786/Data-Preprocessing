# Data-Preprocessing
Feature Engineering is important step of Machine learning project deployment which ultimately helps to improve the accuracy of model. In the given project removed outlier (the data which is out lie, in other words 
out of range data(error))by using different statistics techniques like percentile, Standard Deviation & Z-score are used to remove it.
In first file removes outlier using percentile of human height and secondly, contain the dataset of house prices_per_sqr_ft at different areas using 'Percentile' technique.
In second file removes outlier on both of the same files at first using'Standard Deviation' and then 'Z_score' technique.
Percentile technique used to tell a particular datapoint rank at which level.
Whereas, Standard deviation & Z-score are related to each other. Standard deviation tells a particular datapoint lies how far from the mean. Whereas, Z-score tells how far a datapoint
lie away from the mean.
I have provided the link of dataset of both files here as well:
